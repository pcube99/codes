Let us calculate initial value of i*arr[i] with no rotation
R0 = 0*arr[0] + 1*arr[1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 1 rotation arr[n-1], becomes first element of array, 
arr[0] becomes second element, arr[1] becomes third element
and so on.
R1 = 0*arr[n-1] + 1*arr[0] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-2]

R1 - R0 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2] - (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 2 rotations arr[n-2], becomes first element of array, 
arr[n-1] becomes second element, arr[0] becomes third element
and so on.
R2 = 0*arr[n-2] + 1*arr[n-1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-3]


R2 - R1 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-3] - (n-1)*arr[n-2] + arr[n-1]

If we take a closer look at above values, we can observe 
below pattern

Rj - Rj-1 = arrSum - n * arr[n-j]

Where arrSum is sum of all array elements, i.e., 

arrSum = &Sum; arr[i]
        0<=i<=n-1 

Below is complete algorithm:


1) Compute sum of all array elements. Let this sum be 'arrSum'.

2) Compute R0 by doing i*arr[i] for given array. 
   Let this value be currVal.

3) Initialize result: maxVal = currVal // maxVal is result.

// This loop computes Rj from  Rj-1 
4) Do following for j = 1 to n-1
......a) currVal = currVal + arrSum-n*arr[n-j];
......b) If (currVal > maxVal)
            maxVal = currVal   

5) Return maxVal
